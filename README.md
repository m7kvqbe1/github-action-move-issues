# Move Issue to Project Column

A GitHub Action to move issues between GitHub Projects V2 columns based on specific labels and criteria. It can handle both labeling and unlabeling events.

## Inputs

| Input                    | Description                                                                                                              | Required |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `github-token`           | Create a Personal Access Token (Classic) with the `public_repo` and `project` scopes.                                    | Yes      |
| `project-url`            | The URL of the GitHub Project V2.                                                                                        | Yes      |
| `target-labels`          | Comma-separated list of labels that should trigger the action (e.g., "Size: Small, Size: Medium").                       | Yes      |
| `target-column`          | The target column name to move the issue to when labeled (e.g., "Candidates for Ready").                                 | Yes      |
| `ignored-columns`        | Comma-separated list of column names to ignore (e.g., "Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done").                            | Yes      |
| `default-column`         | The column to move the issue to when a target label is removed. If not specified, no action will be taken on unlabeling. | No       |
| `skip-if-not-in-project` | Skip moving the issue if it is not already in the project (default: `false`)                                             | No       |
| `issue-number`           | Issue number to handle (default: derived from issue itself)                                                              | No       |

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Move Issue on Label Change

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled]

jobs:
  move-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Move Issue to Project Column
        uses: m7kvqbe1/github-action-move-issues@{release}
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
          project-url: "https://github.com/orgs/your-org/projects/1"
          target-labels: "Size: Small, Size: Medium"
          target-column: "Candidates for Ready"
          ignored-columns: "Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done"
          default-column: "To Do" # Optional: Remove this line if you don't want issues moved when labels are removed
```

Get the latest `{release}` tag from https://github.com/m7kvqbe1/github-action-move-issues/releases.

## Behavior

- When an issue is labeled with one of the target labels, it will be moved to the specified target column.
- When all target labels are removed from an issue:
  - If a default column is specified, the issue will be moved to that column.
  - If no default column is specified, no action will be taken.
- The action will not move issues that are already in one of the ignored columns.

## Advanced Behavior

When a pull request is closed, one might want to move the issue, too.
Then, the issue number has to be determined based on the pull request.
For instance, this can be done with the [ticket-check-action](https://github.com/neofinancial/ticket-check-action/pull/58).
Then, one can move the issue to another state as intended.

Example: Move the issue to "In Progress" as soon as a PR is opened or reopened:

```yaml
name: Mark issue as in progress

on:
  pull_request_target:

jobs:
  move_issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - name: Determine issue number
        id: get_issue_number
        uses: koppor/ticket-check-action@add-output
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          ticketLink: 'https://github.com/:owner/:repo/issues/%ticketNumber%'
          ticketPrefix: '#'
          titleRegex: '^#(?<ticketNumber>\d+)'
          branchRegex: '^(?<ticketNumber>\d+)'
          bodyRegex: '#(?<ticketNumber>\d+)'
          bodyURLRegex: 'http(s?):\/\/(github.com)(\/:owner)(\/:repo)(\/issues)\/(?<ticketNumber>\d+)'
          outputOnly: true
      - name: Move issue "In progress"
        uses: m7kvqbe1/github-action-move-issues/@main
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN_ACTION_MOVE_ISSUE }}
          project-url: "https://github.com/users/koppor/projects/7"
          target-labels: "üìç Assigned"
          target-column: "In progress"
          ignored-columns: ""
          default-column: "In progress"
          issue-number: ${{ steps.get_issue_number.outputs.ticketNumber }}
```
